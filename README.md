## What It Does
After a user logs in they can choose to meditate or create a daily intention entry. Within their daily intentions page they look back on previous intentions or create a new one for the day.
Users also have the option to meditate. Within a meditation, there a number of soundscapes to choose from before starting a 20 second guided breathing exorcise. After the meditation is completed, the user will be taken to a meditation reflection page. Recent meditation activity can be viewed from the homepage.

## How It Functions
The API is built using Ruby on Rails. The database is using Postgres so store and manipulate a variety tables. The frontend uses a variety of fetch requests to handle the data from the APi.
